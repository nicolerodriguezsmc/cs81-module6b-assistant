The following are my reflections:

* What made your assistant "personal" to you?
The assistant felt personal because it managed tasks that are real-life tasks from my life. I enjoyed being able to name my assistant.

* What challenges did you face using this?
The challenges I faced when using this were mostly encountered in the update mood segment of the code. Even though it was not specifically called for, I needed a function to update the mood depending on how many tasks were left. I used this.updateMood in both addTask and in completeTask.

* Which method would you improve or expand?
I would expand the updateMood method to consider task types and priorities.
